# C++ Practice Repository

This repository contains simple C++ programs created as part of my coursework.  
The goal is to practice programming fundamentals and build a portfolio.

## Programs
- `hello.cpp`: A basic program that prints a welcome message.

## Notes
This repository will grow as I add more programs and projects during my studies.
